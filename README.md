## Tools and Frameworks

This application is build using the following tools and frameworks:

- Laravel 10
- Laravel Sail
- InertiaJS
- TypeScript
- Vite
- React
- PostCSS
- Tailwind

### Future development

This application is very basic in functionality. For once, it does not have a login/authorisation system in place, and
data in the application cannot yet be managed using a CMS. For this, I would recommend
using [Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com/) as backend framework.
